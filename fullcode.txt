Proposal: Enhancing the T-E-T Poetry Translation Workflow
This proposal outlines a strategy to evolve your AI-powered poetry translation workflow by introducing two distinct sets of prompt templates and configurations: one optimized for reasoning models (like deepseek-reasoner) and another refined for high-performance non-reasoning models (like qwen-plus).

The core principle is to shift from prescriptive instruction for non-reasoning models to guided cognition for reasoning models, thereby maximizing the unique strengths of each architecture.

1. High-Level Strategy: Guided Cognition vs. Prescriptive Instruction
Non-Reasoning Models (Instruction-Following): These models excel at following detailed, step-by-step instructions. Your current prompts are already well-suited for this paradigm. They work by breaking down the complex task of translation into a manageable checklist, ensuring all bases are covered. We will refine these slightly for clarity and efficiency.

Reasoning Models (Cognitive Simulation): These models can perform complex, multi-step reasoning internally. Instead of giving them a rigid checklist, the goal is to provide a persona, a goal, and a framework for them to "think" through the problem. We will use techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT), asking the model to externalize its reasoning process before producing the final output. This unlocks a deeper, more nuanced level of analysis and creativity.

2. Proposed Prompt Templates
I propose creating two new sets of prompt files. The originals will serve as the basis for the non-reasoning track.

a. Reasoning Model Prompt Templates
These prompts encourage the model to perform and show its reasoning within a <thinking> block before delivering the final output. This meta-cognition step significantly improves the quality of complex tasks like poetry translation.

system: |
  You are a renowned poet and professional {{ source_lang }}-to-{{ target_lang }} poetry
  translator. Your artistry lies in creating translations that are not merely literal,
  but are themselves profound works of art, capturing the original's beauty, musicality,
  and emotional soul. You possess a deep, intuitive understanding of both {{ source_lang }}
  and {{ target_lang }} poetic traditions.

user: |
  Your task is to produce a high-fidelity, poetically resonant translation of the following
  poem from {{ source_lang }} to {{ target_lang }}.

  <SOURCE_TEXT>
  {{ original_poem }}
  </SOURCE_TEXT>

  First, in a <thinking> block, externalize your entire analytical and creative process.
  Let's work this out step-by-step:
  1.  **Initial Immersion:** Identify the poet, title, and form. Briefly research the poet's
      style, the poem's historical/cultural context, and its core themes and mood.
  2.  **Deep Analysis:** Go through the poem stanza by stanza, or even line by line.
      Deconstruct key imagery, metaphors, wordplay, and cultural references.
      Analyze the rhythm, meter, and rhyme scheme. Create a mental glossary of challenging
      or pivotal words and phrases, exploring their semantic range.
  3.  **Strategic Approach:** Outline your translation strategy. How will you handle the
      form? How will you adapt the rhythm and sound devices for a {{ target_lang }}
      audience? What will be the biggest challenges?
  4.  **Creative Exploration (Opening Line):** Draft and critique at least three distinct
      versions of the opening line. Analyze the pros and cons of each regarding meaning,
      tone, and musicality, and state which one you will proceed with and why.
  5.  **Drafting:** Based on your analysis, produce at least two complete, distinct draft
      translations of the poem.
  6.  **Selection and Refinement:** Compare your drafts. Select the strongest one, or create
      a hybrid, explaining your final choice. This version will become your final translation.

  After your detailed thinking process, provide the final, polished translation and your
  translator's notes in the specified format.

  Format your response as follows, without any explanation before the first XML tag:
  <thinking>
  [Your detailed, step-by-step reasoning process as outlined above]
  </thinking>
  <initial_translation>
  [Your final, polished translation, including title and poet]
  </initial_translation>
  <initial_translation_notes>
  [Your brief (200-300 words) explanation of translation choices, summarizing the key points from your thinking process, focusing on challenges, creative decisions, cultural elements, and form/rhythm adaptation.]

  First, in an <analysis> block, think through your evaluation.
  1.  **Synthesize the Translator's Intent:** Begin by reading the translator's notes.
      What were their goals, challenges, and key decisions? Understand their perspective before
      beginning your critique.
  2.  **Comparative Reading:** Read the original and the translation side-by-side.
      Compare them line-by-line and as holistic works. Identify areas of strong alignment
      and points of divergence in meaning, tone, rhythm, and form.
  3.  **Critical Assessment:** Systematically evaluate the translation against key criteria:
      Faithfulness (accuracy, form), Expressiveness (fluency, poetic devices),
      Elegance (word choice, aesthetic beauty), and Cultural Resonance.
      Pinpoint specific lines or phrases that could be improved. Consider alternative
      interpretations or word choices.

  First, in a <thinking> block, deliberate on the revision process.
  1.  **Evaluate Suggestions:** Go through each expert suggestion one by one.
      Critically assess its validity. Decide whether you will accept, partially accept,
      or reject it. For each decision, briefly state your rationale. If you accept a suggestion,
      consider if you can refine it even further.
  2.  **Holistic Review Plan:** After considering the specific feedback, step back
      and formulate a plan for a holistic review of the entire poem. Are there any systemic
      issues (e.g., tone, rhythm) that need addressing based on the feedback?
  3.  **Final Polish:** Read the revised translation aloud (metaphorically). Check for
      flow, musicality, and consistency. Make any final, subtle adjustments to perfect the piece.

  After your deliberation, provide the revised translation and your notes on the revision process.

  Format your response as follows, without any explanation before the first XML tag:

  </revised_translation_notes>
b. Non-Reasoning Model Prompt Templates
Your existing prompts are excellent for this category. The proposed changes are minor refinements for clarity and to ensure maximum focus from the LLM. We will reuse them with slight modifications. I'll name them with an _nr suffix for clarity in the file system.

prompts/initial_translation_nr.yaml: Your original initial_translation.yaml is nearly perfect. The numbered list is clear and directive. No major changes are needed.

prompts/editor_review_nr.yaml: Your original editor_review.yaml is also very effective. Its structured approach to feedback is ideal for these models. No major changes are needed.

prompts/translator_revision_nr.yaml: Your original translator_revision.yaml clearly outlines the task. No major changes are needed.

The main takeaway is that your current prompts are already optimized for non-reasoning models. By creating the new _reasoning set, you are adding capability without losing the effectiveness of your current setup.

3. Proposed Model Configurations and Parameters
To manage these two tracks, I recommend structuring your default.yaml to define distinct workflows. This allows you to easily switch between reasoning, non-reasoning, or hybrid models.

4. Rationale for Parameter Adjustments
Temperature: In the reasoning workflow, the initial translation step (initial_translation) is given a higher temperature (0.8) to encourage creative exploration and generate more diverse drafts. The analytical steps (editor_review, translator_revision) use a lower temperature (0.3-0.4) to ensure the model's reasoning is logical, focused, and deterministic.

Max Tokens: Reasoning prompts require a higher token limit (8192) because the model's output now includes extensive <thinking> or <analysis> blocks in addition to the final product.

5. Implementation and Evaluation
Create New Files: Create the new _reasoning.yaml prompt templates and rename your existing ones to _nr.yaml.

Update default.yaml: Replace your workflow block with the workflow_reasoning, workflow_non_reasoning, and workflow_hybrid blocks as defined above.

Test and Compare: Run the same poem through all three workflows. Compare the outputs.

Expect the reasoning workflow to produce translations with deeper structural and thematic understanding, potentially offering more creative but well-justified solutions to complex translation problems.

Expect the non-reasoning workflow to be highly reliable and consistent, closely adhering to the provided instructions.

The hybrid workflow remains a strong option, leveraging the reasoning model for the most difficult analytical task (editing).

By implementing this dual-track approach, you are not just updating prompts; you are building a more sophisticated and flexible translation platform that can intelligently deploy the best AI architecture for each specific cognitive task in the creative process.

Below is a comprehensive, expert-level redesign of your T–E–T workflow for both reasoning and non-reasoning LLMs. It includes:

Strategic analysis of the current prompts and where reasoning models differ
Two full prompt template sets per step:
Reasoning models: minimal interference with chain-of-thought (CoT), explicit tool-use style, and structured thinking without eliciting hidden rationales in outputs
Non-reasoning models: refined versions of your existing prompts with small upgrades, retaining their output format contracts
Model parameter recommendations tuned per step and per model class
Updated default.yaml variants to enable “reasoning,” “non-reasoning,” and “hybrid” runs
Operational best practices (guardrails, glossary handling, style consistency, evaluation)
Key principles guiding the redesign

Respect model cognition mode:

Reasoning LLMs: Avoid step-by-step enumerations that force surface CoT in the final answer. Encourage silent reasoning with “think silently,” “do not reveal analysis,” and “only output in the required XML blocks.” Provide compact rubrics and checklists that guide internal reasoning.
Non-reasoning LLMs: Explicit step-by-step instructions remain beneficial and stable.
Preserve output schemas:

Keep your existing XML interface exactly, so downstream tooling remains unchanged.
Require: only two blocks for each step, with exact tags.
Optimize per step:

Initial translation: generative, creative fidelity; medium temperature.
Editor review: analytical, low temperature; longer context window and higher max tokens for critique.
Translator revision: integrative craft; low temperature, slightly higher than editor if rhythm reshaping is needed.
Add compact QA rubrics:

Use short, high-signal checklists that reasoning models can internalize without dumping CoT.
Keep cultural and formal fidelity:

Emphasize: cadence, lineation, sonic texture (assonance/alliteration), socio-historical context, and title/opening line salience.
Part A. Prompt templates for reasoning models

A1. initial_translation.reasoning.yaml

System:
You are a renowned poet and professional {{ source_lang }}→{{ target_lang }} translator. Your mission: produce a faithful, musically compelling poem in {{ target_lang }} that preserves the original’s imagery, tone, cultural resonance, and (when apt) form. You are deeply versed in both traditions and skilled at adaptive prosody.

Think silently; do not reveal your analysis. Only output the required XML blocks.

User:
Task: Translate the poem from {{ source_lang }} to {{ target_lang }}.

Source (verbatim):
<SOURCE_TEXT>
{{ original_poem }}
</SOURCE_TEXT>

Deliverables (in this exact order):

<initial_translation>…</initial_translation>
Provide only the final translation first, including the poem’s title and poet’s name, no notes.
Preserve stanza breaks and lineation. Retain or adapt form and musicality.
Avoid literal calques if they impair rhythm or tone; prefer idiomatic, poetic solutions faithful to meaning and mood.
<initial_translation_notes>…</initial_translation_notes>
200–300 words explaining key choices and challenges, including:
Opening line: list 3 considered options; justify final choice.
Form/rhythm: how you adapted meter/rhyme/cadence.
Cultural or historical elements: how handled.
Notable creative equivalences for untranslatable devices.
Internal checklist (do not output):

Identify title/poet, period, style traits.
Map the poem’s dominant images, narrative voice, and tonal arc.
Track key terms/lexemes to maintain semantic motifs.
If form is strict (e.g., sonnet), attempt a functional equivalent (rhyme density, volta, closure).
Readback test for euphony in {{ target_lang }}; refine for breath and stress.
Output only the two XML sections. Do not include the source text in your output.

A2. editor_review.reasoning.yaml

System:
You are a bilingual literary critic in {{ source_lang }}↔{{ target_lang }} with strong philology and metrics expertise. Adopt a fresh, critical perspective. Think silently and do not reveal stepwise analysis. Only output the required XML block.

temperature: 0.2–0.35; recommend 0.25
frequency_penalty: 0.2
max_tokens: ~7,500–8,000
Timeouts and retries: Keep your current global settings; increase request_timeout to 45–60s for editor_review on long poems.

Part D. default.yaml variants for flexible workflows

You asked to control selection via default.yaml. Below are three concrete configurations you can adopt. Adjust provider identifiers to your infra.

D1. All-reasoning workflow

workflow:
name: "vox_poetica_translation_reasoning"
version: "1.1.0"
steps:
initial_translation:
provider: "deepseek"
model: "deepseek-reasoner"
temperature: 0.65
top_p: 0.9
frequency_penalty: 0.2
max_tokens: 5500
prompt_template: "prompts/initial_translation.reasoning.yaml"
timeout: 180.0
retry_attempts: 3
editor_review:
provider: "deepseek"
model: "deepseek-reasoner"
temperature: 0.25
top_p: 0.9
frequency_penalty: 0.2
max_tokens: 8500
prompt_template: "prompts/editor_review.reasoning.yaml"
timeout: 180.0
retry_attempts: 3
translator_revision:

D2. All–non-reasoning workflow (close to your current)

workflow:
name: "vox_poetica_translation_nonreasoning"
version: "1.1.0"
steps:
initial_translation:
provider: "tongyi"
model: "qwen-max-latest"
temperature: 0.7
top_p: 0.9
frequency_penalty: 0.2
max_tokens: 4096
prompt_template: "prompts/initial_translation.nonreasoning.yaml"
timeout: 180.0
retry_attempts: 3
editor_review:
provider: "deepseek"
model: "deepseek-chat"
temperature: 0.3
top_p: 0.9
frequency_penalty: 0.2
max_tokens: 8192
prompt_template: "prompts/editor_review.nonreasoning.yaml"
timeout: 180.0
retry_attempts: 3
translator_revision:
provider: "tongyi"
model: "qwen-max-latest"
temperature: 0.25

frequency_penalty: 0.2
max_tokens: 8001
prompt_template: "prompts/translator_revision.nonreasoning.yaml"
timeout: 180.0
retry_attempts: 3

D3. Hybrid workflow (reasoning for critique, non-reasoning for generation)

workflow:
name: "vox_poetica_translation_hybrid"
version: "1.1.0"
steps:
initial_translation:
provider: "tongyi"
model: "qwen-max-latest"
temperature: 0.7
top_p: 0.9
frequency_penalty: 0.2
max_tokens: 4500
prompt_template: "prompts/initial_translation.nonreasoning.yaml"
timeout: 180.0
retry_attempts: 3
editor_review:
provider: "deepseek"
model: "deepseek-reasoner"
temperature: 0.25
top_p: 0.9
frequency_penalty: 0.2
max_tokens: 9000
prompt_template: "prompts/editor_review.reasoning.yaml"
timeout: 180.0
retry_attempts: 3
translator_revision:
provider: "tongyi"
model: "qwen-max-latest"
temperature: 0.3
top_p: 0.9
frequency_penalty: 0.2
max_tokens: 8001
prompt_template: "prompts/translator_revision.nonreasoning.yaml"
timeout: 180.0
retry_attempts: 3

Part E. Provider settings

Keep existing provider_settings; consider request_timeout:
editor_review on reasoning models: 45–60s
connection_pool_size: 10 is fine; increase to 20 if concurrency grows.
Logging: retain INFO; add per-step timing metrics to correlate latency with token usage.
Part F. Additional best practices and enhancements

Glossary propagation:

Add optional “glossary” object to carry key lexemes across steps. In initial_translation notes, prompt to emit a compact glossary (term → chosen rendering). Feed this into editor_review and translator_revision via an extra tag <GLOSSARY> to stabilize motif consistency, especially for technical or culturally loaded terms. This is optional but valuable for long works.
Title and opening line salience:

You already emphasize opening line. For strict forms (e.g., sonnet), add “volta recognition” in internal checklist; for haiku/tanka, explicitly mention syllabic or kireji-function equivalence.
Musicality tests:

Encourage near-final read-aloud mental test in translator_revision, which often surfaces clunky enjambments or terminal rhyme collisions.
Cultural notes minimalism:

Avoid discursive notes in the poem. Place any necessary gloss in the notes block only.
Style consistency:

Guide non-reasoning models to reuse chosen diction for recurring images (e.g., “frost,” “rime,” “hoarfrost”); suggest one canonical choice unless parallelism is intended.
Evaluation loop (offline):

Implement a lightweight automatic regression test set: for 10–15 canonical poems per language pair, cache final outputs and track diffs after prompt/model changes. Human raters score: fidelity, musicality, tone, cultural adequacy, and readability. Maintain a leaderboard per configuration.
Safety and correctness:

In editor_review, explicitly ask to “flag any untranslated fragments or hallucinated additions.” Already implied but worth making explicit in your non-reasoning prompt; included in the rubric above.
Token economy:

For very long poems, chunk by canto/section with a “global register sheet” (running glossary + style notes). Support that later as an advanced mode.
Summary

Reasoning set: compact, “think silently,” with internal checklists; avoids forcing CoT in outputs; preserves your XML interface; tuned temperatures maximize creativity where needed and precision for critique.
Non-reasoning set: refined but familiar; stepwise guidance retained.
Configurations: supplied three default.yaml variants to run reasoning, non-reasoning, or hybrid workflows.
Added operational best practices: glossary handoffs, read-aloud checks, cultural minimalism, human eval loop.
Please generate the four .yaml prompt files verbatim (three steps × two modes = six files), and two ready-to-drop default.yaml variants matching your repository structure.

Comprehensive Optimization Proposal for Vox Poetica Studio AI Poetry Translation Workflow

Executive Summary

This proposal provides a significant enhancement to your existing Translator-Editor-Translator (T-E-T) workflow by introducing specialized prompt templates optimized for both reasoning and non-reasoning large language models. Based on extensive research into model capabilities and poetry translation best practices, the proposed solution enables three distinct operational modes: pure reasoning, pure non-reasoning, and hybrid workflows. The optimization focuses on leveraging each model's architectural strengths while maintaining your core requirement of preserving poetic aesthetic beauty, musicality, and cultural resonance. Implementation requires minimal changes to your existing infrastructure while promising substantial improvements in translation quality and workflow flexibility.

1 Workflow Analysis and Current State Assessment

1.1 Current Workflow Strengths and Limitations

Your existing T-E-T workflow demonstrates sophisticated understanding of poetry translation nuances, with several notable strengths:

Comprehensive translation methodology covering form preservation, cultural adaptation, and poetic device maintenance
Structured multi-stage process that mirrors professional human translation workflows
Detailed analytical frameworks for evaluating translation quality across multiple dimensions
Appropriate model selection with Qwen for creative tasks and DeepSeek for analytical tasks
However, the current implementation has specific limitations when applied to modern reasoning models:

Potential interference with inherent chain-of-thought processes in reasoning models
Undifferentiated prompting strategies that don't leverage architectural differences
Suboptimal parameter configurations for advanced reasoning capabilities
Missing opportunities for model-specific strength utilization
1.2 Reasoning vs. Non-Reasoning Model Characteristics

Based on official documentation and technical research, key differences necessitate specialized prompting approaches:

Characteristic	Reasoning Models (DeepSeek Reasoner)	Non-Reasoning Models (Qwen)
Primary Strength	Complex reasoning, step-by-step analysis, self-correction	Pattern recognition, fluency, creative generation
Optimal Prompt Style	Explicit chain-of-thought encouragement, problem decomposition	Direct instruction with examples, structured templates
Processing Approach	Deliberative, multi-step reasoning before response	Immediate pattern-based response generation
Key Parameters	Higher temperature for creative reasoning, longer max tokens	Lower temperature for focused output, standard token limits
2 Reasoning Model Prompt Template Design

The following prompt templates are specifically engineered for DeepSeek Reasoner and similar reasoning-focused models, incorporating explicit chain-of-thought scaffolding while maintaining your core poetry translation requirements.

5 Implementation Strategy and Best Practices

5.1 Workflow Selection Guidelines

Based on your requirements and model capabilities, here are recommendations for workflow selection:

Pure Reasoning Workflow: Best for complex, nuanced poetry with dense cultural references and intricate poetic forms. Use when translation quality is paramount and processing time is less critical.
Pure Non-Reasoning Workflow: Ideal for higher-volume translation tasks or when working with more straightforward poetic forms. Provides good quality with faster processing times.
Hybrid Workflow: Recommended as default configuration for balanced performance. Leverages Qwen's creative strengths for translation generation while utilizing DeepSeek's analytical capabilities for rigorous editorial review.
5.2 Performance Optimization Tips

Batch Processing: For non-reasoning workflows, consider batch processing multiple poems to optimize resource utilization.
Progressive Temperature Adjustment: Use higher temperatures (0.7-0.8) for creative translation tasks, lower temperatures (0.3-0.4) for analytical review tasks.
Token Allocation: Reserve higher token limits for editor review stages where comprehensive analysis is most valuable.
Fallback Strategies: Implement automatic fallback to non-reasoning models if reasoning model availability is limited.
5.3 Quality Assurance Measures

Cross-Model Validation: Periodically validate translations across different workflow configurations to ensure consistency.
Human-in-the-Loop: Maintain your current human evaluation stage as final quality gate.
Metric Tracking: Implement translation quality metrics based on your established evaluation criteria to quantitatively compare workflow performance.

<code>
Here’s a practical, expert-level upgrade plan for your Vox Poetica Studio Web (VPSW) prompts and configs so you can run pure reasoning, pure non-reasoning, or hybrid T–E–T workflows reliably, with improved translation quality and robust formatting guarantees.

Overview

Goal: Preserve your strong T–E–T structure while making it “model-aware,” so reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek Reasoner) can think privately and deeply without leaking chain-of-thought, and non-reasoning models (e.g., Qwen Max/Plus) can stay focused and fluent.
Approach: Provide two full prompt sets (Reasoning vs Non-Reasoning) for each step (Initial Translation, Editor Review, Translator Revision) with consistent, strict output formats and formatting guardrails.
Config: Provide three default.yaml variants (reasoning, non-reasoning, hybrid) so you can switch profiles easily. No assumptions about runner conditionals; you can swap the default.yaml you load per run.
Best practices applied: From DeepSeek/Qwen/OpenAI guidance—separate private “scratchpad” reasoning from public outputs; use strict output formats; reduce scaffolding that could conflict with internal chains-of-thought; set temperatures by task (creative vs critical); reserve larger token budgets for reasoning steps; add stop sequences to prevent trailing content.
What changes and why

Reasoning models
Give them freedom to reason privately; explicitly forbid chain-of-thought in the output.
Avoid intrusive step-by-step scaffolding in outputs; keep the deep analysis internal.
Keep deliverables concise, structured, and compliant (XML only).
Non-reasoning models
Keep your current prompts (they’re already strong), add light guardrails for formatting and brevity, and small clarity tweaks.
Across both
Tighten output format constraints to ensure machine-parseability.
Prioritize high-value creative decisions (opening line, rhythm, form) while containing verbosity.
Suggest stop sequences and temperature ranges tuned per step.

Parameter rationale and tuning guidance

Temperatures
Creative generation (Initial Translation): 0.55–0.7. Reasoners can be around 0.6; Qwen creative sweet spot ~0.65–0.75 depending on form constraints.
Critical review (Editor Review): 0.2–0.35 for precision and consistency.
Polishing (Translator Revision): 0.3–0.4—enough flexibility to refine rhyme and diction without drifting.
top_p
0.9–0.95 is a reliable range for poetry to keep diversity without incoherence.
max_tokens
Reasoning steps need larger budgets because they internally deliberate. Set 6500–8000. Increase for long poems.
stop sequences
Very effective for enforcing clean outputs when you demand strict XML. Use the closing tag of each required block as the stop sequence.
Penalties
You can add mild frequency_penalty (0.2) to reduce repeats in long lyric lines, especially in Qwen non-reasoning mode.
Additional best practices integrated

Hidden scratchpad for reasoning models: lets DeepSeek Reasoner do the heavy lifting without emitting chain-of-thought. You still get a 200–300 word “translation notes” section that is high-level and useful.
Guardrails for XML compliance: explicit “no extra text or code fences” plus stop sequences.
Respect for meter and rhyme: each prompt explicitly emphasizes scansion, musicality, and opening-line selection—a high-impact artistic lever.
Cultural nuance: prompts explicitly require decisions on cultural references and degree of localization.
Consistency and read-aloud checks: built into both initial and revision steps.
Rollout plan

Start with the Hybrid profile: Reasoning for Initial Translation and Translator Revision, deepseek-chat or qwen for Editor Review. This often yields the best cost-quality balance.
A/B test against your existing workflow on a curated set of poems across forms (sonnet, free verse, classical regulated verse, haiku, ghazal).
Evaluate with human raters using the same rubric embedded in the Editor Review prompt.
Optional QA utility (quick lint to verify XML blocks)

Python

import re

def extract_block(text, tag):
    pattern = fr"<{tag}>([\s\S]*?)</{tag}>"
    m = re.search(pattern, text)
    return m.group(1).strip() if m else None

def validate_initial_translation_output(s):
    t = extract_block(s, "initial_translation")
    n = extract_block(s, "initial_translation_notes")
    return (t is not None) and (n is not None)

def validate_editor_output(s):
    return extract_block(s, "editor_suggestions") is not None

def validate_revision_output(s):
    t = extract_block(s, "revised_translation")
    n = extract_block(s, "revised_translation_notes")
    return (t is not None) and (n is not None)
Summary

The reasoning prompts let DeepSeek Reasoner fully leverage its private deliberation while guaranteeing clean, parseable outputs.
The non-reasoning prompts preserve your proven structure with minimal, effective guardrails.
Three ready-to-run default.yaml profiles enable easy mode selection for your T–E–T pipeline.
These changes should yield higher fidelity to form and music, more consistent cultural handling, and better overall polish—while keeping outputs machine-friendly for your web workflow.

# Vox Poetica Studio Web: Reasoning Model Optimization Proposal

## Executive Summary

This proposal presents a comprehensive optimization strategy for the VPS Web poetry translation workflow, introducing dual-mode prompt templates optimized for reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI o1/o3) and non-reasoning models (e.g., Qwen-Plus, GPT-4). The optimization is based on extensive research into reasoning model prompt engineering best practices and poetry translation methodologies.

**Key Findings from Research:**
- **Reasoning models require minimal, clear prompts** - avoid explicit step-by-step instructions
- **Zero-shot prompting outperforms few-shot** for reasoning models
- **Remove Chain-of-Thought (CoT) scaffolding** - reasoning models generate internal reasoning automatically
- **Focus on clear problem definition** rather than process instructions
- **Lower temperature settings** (0.1-0.3) work better for reasoning models
- **Explicit output formatting** is still necessary and beneficial

## 1. Reasoning Model Prompt Design Principles

### 1.1 Key Differences: Reasoning vs Non-Reasoning Models

| Aspect | Reasoning Models | Non-Reasoning Models |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Prompt Style** | Minimal, direct, clear | Detailed, step-by-step guidance |
| **Instructions** | What to achieve | How to achieve it |
| **Examples** | Zero-shot preferred | Few-shot can help |
| **CoT Prompting** | Avoid (interference) | Beneficial |
| **Temperature** | 0.1-0.3 | 0.2-0.7 |
| **Reasoning** | Internal, automatic | Must be explicitly prompted |
| **Max Tokens** | Higher (8K-16K) | Moderate (4K-8K) |

### 1.2 Reasoning Model Optimization Strategy

For reasoning models in poetry translation:
1. **Present the core task clearly** - what needs to be translated
2. **Specify success criteria** - faithfulness, musicality, cultural resonance
3. **Remove procedural scaffolding** - let the model determine its own approach
4. **Maintain output structure requirements** - XML tags for parsing
5. **Trust the model's internal reasoning** - it will consider nuances automatically

## 2. Proposed Workflow Configurations

### 2.1 Three Workflow Modes

```yaml
# Mode 1: Pure Reasoning Workflow (Optimal for complex poetry)
workflow_mode: "reasoning"
steps:
  initial_translation: reasoning
  editor_review: reasoning  
  translator_revision: reasoning

# Mode 2: Pure Non-Reasoning Workflow (Faster, cost-effective)
workflow_mode: "non_reasoning"
steps:
  initial_translation: non_reasoning
  editor_review: non_reasoning
  translator_revision: non_reasoning

# Mode 3: Hybrid Workflow (Balanced approach)
workflow_mode: "hybrid"
steps:
  initial_translation: non_reasoning    # Fast initial draft
  editor_review: reasoning              # Deep critical analysis
  translator_revision: non_reasoning    # Efficient refinement
```

### 2.2 Model Parameter Optimization

```yaml
# Reasoning Model Parameters
reasoning_params:
  temperature: 0.2          # Lower for consistency
  max_tokens: 16384         # Higher for extended reasoning
  top_p: 0.95              # Maintain diversity
  timeout: 300.0           # Longer for reasoning time

# Non-Reasoning Model Parameters  
non_reasoning_params:
  temperature: 0.5-0.7     # Moderate for creativity
  max_tokens: 8192         # Standard range
  top_p: 0.9
  timeout: 180.0
```

### 4.4 Non-Reasoning Mode Prompts

For non-reasoning models, the current prompt templates are already well-designed with appropriate step-by-step guidance. Recommended changes are minimal:

**Minor Refinements:**

1. **Consistency in terminology** - ensure "source_lang" and "target_lang" are used uniformly
2. **Clarified output format** - slightly more explicit XML tag usage instructions
3. **Enhanced quality criteria** - more specific success metrics
4. **Streamlined redundancy** - remove a few repetitive phrases

The existing templates in your documents serve as the foundation for non-reasoning mode prompts with these minor adjustments applied.

## 6. Implementation Recommendations

### 6.1 Phased Rollout

**Phase 1: Infrastructure (Week 1)**
- Implement workflow mode selection logic
- Add prompt template routing based on model type
- Update configuration file parsing
- Add model classification system

**Phase 2: Prompt Template Creation (Week 1-2)**
- Create reasoning mode prompt templates
- Refine non-reasoning mode prompts
- Validate XML output parsing with both modes
- Test with sample poems

**Phase 3: Testing & Validation (Week 2-3)**
- Conduct A/B testing across workflow modes
- Human evaluation of translation quality
- Performance benchmarking (latency, cost)
- Edge case testing

**Phase 4: Optimization (Week 3-4)**
- Fine-tune temperature and token parameters
- Refine prompts based on test results
- Optimize cost-performance tradeoffs
- Document best practices

### 6.2 Quality Assurance Strategy

**Evaluation Metrics:**
1. **Translation Quality (Human Evaluation)**
   - Faithfulness to original (1-5 scale)
   - Naturalness in target language (1-5 scale)
   - Preservation of poetic devices (1-5 scale)
   - Overall aesthetic quality (1-5 scale)

2. **Performance Metrics**
   - Latency (seconds per step)
   - Total workflow time
   - Token usage
   - Estimated cost per translation

3. **Consistency Metrics**
   - Terminology consistency
   - Style consistency
   - Format compliance

**Testing Dataset:**
- 20-30 diverse poems covering:
  - Different forms (sonnets, haiku, free verse, etc.)
  - Various eras (classical to contemporary)
  - Multiple difficulty levels
  - Different cultural contexts

### 6.3 Cost-Performance Optimization

**Cost Considerations:**

| Workflow Mode | Relative Cost | Quality Level | Use Case |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| Reasoning | ~3-5x higher | Highest | Critical translations, complex poetry |
| Non-Reasoning | 1x baseline | High | Standard translations, volume work |
| Hybrid | ~1.5-2x | Very High | Balanced quality-cost |

**Recommendations:**
- **Reasoning workflow:** Use for literary publications, contested translations, culturally complex works
- **Hybrid workflow:** Default for most professional translations
- **Non-Reasoning workflow:** High-volume projects, initial drafts, less critical works

### 6.4 Model Selection Guidelines

**Initial Translation:**
- **Reasoning:** Deep contextual understanding, cultural nuance detection
- **Non-Reasoning:** Faster, creative exploration, good baseline
- **Recommendation:** Non-reasoning for speed, reasoning for complexity

**Editor Review:**
- **Reasoning:** Superior critical analysis, nuanced feedback
- **Non-Reasoning:** Adequate for straightforward issues
- **Recommendation:** Reasoning strongly preferred (highest value)

**Translator Revision:**
- **Reasoning:** Sophisticated feedback integration, subtle refinements
- **Non-Reasoning:** Efficient implementation of clear suggestions
- **Recommendation:** Non-reasoning often sufficient if editor used reasoning

## 7. Technical Implementation Notes

### 7.1 Code Structure Changes

**New Files Required:**
```
config/
  prompts/
    initial_translation_reasoning.yaml       # New
    editor_review_reasoning.yaml            # New
    translator_revision_reasoning.yaml      # New
    initial_translation_nonreasoning.yaml   # Minor updates
    editor_review_nonreasoning.yaml         # Minor updates
    translator_revision_nonreasoning.yaml   # Minor updates
  models.yaml                                # Enhanced
  default.yaml                               # Significantly enhanced
```

**Core Logic Changes:**
```python
# Workflow mode selector
def select_workflow_config(mode: str) -> dict:
    """Select workflow configuration based on mode."""
    if mode == "reasoning":
        return config["workflow"]["reasoning_workflow"]
    elif mode == "non_reasoning":
        return config["workflow"]["non_reasoning_workflow"]
    elif mode == "hybrid":
        return config["workflow"]["hybrid_workflow"]
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid workflow mode: {mode}")

# Automatic prompt template selection
def get_prompt_template(step: str, model: str) -> str:
    """Determine prompt template based on model type."""
    if model in config["model_classification"]["reasoning_models"]:
        return f"prompts/{step}_reasoning.yaml"
    else:
        return f"prompts/{step}_nonreasoning.yaml"

# Model parameter optimization
def get_optimized_params(model: str, step: str) -> dict:
    """Return optimized parameters for model and step."""
    is_reasoning = model in config["model_classification"]["reasoning_models"]
    
    base_params = {
        "temperature": get_temperature(step, is_reasoning),
        "max_tokens": 16384 if is_reasoning else 8192,
        "timeout": 300.0 if is_reasoning else 180.0,
    }
    return base_params

def get_temperature(step: str, is_reasoning: bool) -> float:
    """Determine optimal temperature for step and model type."""
    if is_reasoning:
        return {
            "initial_translation": 0.2,
            "editor_review": 0.1,
            "translator_revision": 0.15,
        }[step]
    else:
        return {
            "initial_translation": 0.7,
            "editor_review": 0.3,
            "translator_revision": 0.2,
        }[step]
```

### 7.2 Configuration Validation

```python
def validate_workflow_config(config: dict) -> bool:
    """Validate workflow configuration."""
    required_modes = ["reasoning_workflow", "non_reasoning_workflow", "hybrid_workflow"]
    required_steps = ["initial_translation", "editor_review", "translator_revision"]
    
    for mode in required_modes:
        if mode not in config["workflow"]:
            raise ConfigError(f"Missing workflow mode: {mode}")
        
        for step in required_steps:
            if step not in config["workflow"][mode]:
                raise ConfigError(f"Missing step {step} in {mode}")
    
    return True
```

## 8. Advanced Optimization Strategies

### 8.1 Dynamic Temperature Adjustment

For reasoning models, consider dynamic temperature based on poem characteristics:

```yaml
# Advanced temperature strategy
temperature_strategy:
  reasoning_models:
    simple_poem:      0.15  # Straightforward translation
    complex_poem:     0.25  # More creative freedom needed
    cultural_heavy:   0.20  # Balance accuracy and adaptation
    
  non_reasoning_models:
    simple_poem:      0.5
    complex_poem:     0.7
    cultural_heavy:   0.6
```

### 8.2 Iterative Refinement Option

Consider adding an optional fourth step for high-stakes translations:

```yaml
# Optional final refinement step
final_refinement:
  enabled: false  # Opt-in only
  provider: "deepseek"
  model: "deepseek-reasoner"
  temperature: 0.1
  prompt_template: "prompts/final_refinement_reasoning.yaml"
  trigger_conditions:
    - editor_concern_level: high
    - cultural_complexity: high
    - client_tier: premium
```

### 8.3 Ensemble Approach

For maximum quality on critical translations:

```yaml
# Ensemble configuration
ensemble_mode:
  enabled: false
  strategy: "parallel_comparison"
  workflows:
    - "reasoning"
    - "hybrid"
  selection: "human_review"  # or "automated_scoring"
```

## 9. Monitoring and Analytics

### 9.1 Key Metrics to Track

```yaml
# Monitoring configuration
analytics:
  quality_metrics:
    - translation_faithfulness
    - target_language_fluency
    - poetic_device_preservation
    - cultural_appropriateness
    
  performance_metrics:
    - step_latency
    - total_workflow_time
    - token_usage_per_step
    - api_call_success_rate
    
  cost_metrics:
    - cost_per_translation
    - cost_per_workflow_mode
    - monthly_total_cost
    
  comparative_metrics:
    - reasoning_vs_nonreasoning_quality
    - workflow_mode_effectiveness
    - model_performance_by_poem_type
```

### 9.2 A/B Testing Framework

```python
# A/B testing implementation
def run_ab_test(poem: str, num_iterations: int = 10):
    """Compare workflow modes on same poem."""
    results = {
        "reasoning": [],
        "non_reasoning": [],
        "hybrid": []
    }
    
    for mode in ["reasoning", "non_reasoning", "hybrid"]:
        for i in range(num_iterations):
            translation = run_workflow(poem, mode=mode)
            quality_score = evaluate_translation(translation)
            results[mode].append({
                "iteration": i,
                "translation": translation,
                "quality_score": quality_score,
                "latency": translation.metadata.latency,
                "cost": translation.metadata.estimated_cost
            })
    
    return analyze_ab_results(results)
```

## 10. Migration Guide

### 10.1 For Existing Users

**Step 1: Backup Current Configuration**
```bash
cp config/default.yaml config/default.yaml.backup
cp -r config/prompts config/prompts.backup
```

**Step 2: Update Configuration Files**
```bash
# Copy new configuration files
cp new_configs/default.yaml config/
cp new_configs/models.yaml config/
cp -r new_prompts/* config/prompts/
```

**Step 3: Test with Sample Poem**
```bash
# Test each workflow mode
python vpsweb.py --workflow-mode reasoning --input sample_poem.txt
python vpsweb.py --workflow-mode non_reasoning --input sample_poem.txt
python vpsweb.py --workflow-mode hybrid --input sample_poem.txt
```

**Step 4: Compare Results**
```bash
# Run comparison analysis
python scripts/compare_workflows.py outputs/
```

### 10.2 Breaking Changes

- **Configuration Structure:** New workflow mode structure replaces single-step configuration
- **Prompt Templates:** Separate templates for reasoning vs non-reasoning modes
- **API Parameters:** Different timeout and max_tokens for reasoning models
- **Output Format:** Optionally includes workflow mode tag in filename

**Migration Path:**
- Existing configurations will continue to work (backwards compatible)
- New `workflow_mode` key defaults to "hybrid" if not specified
- Old prompt templates automatically mapped to non-reasoning mode
- Gradual migration recommended: test new modes, then switch default

## 11. Future Enhancements

### 11.1 Short-term (1-3 months)
- Fine-tuning specific models on poetry translation corpus
- Automated quality scoring system
- Multi-language support expansion
- Web UI for workflow mode selection

### 11.2 Medium-term (3-6 months)

## Appendix A: Complete Prompt Templates

### A.1 Initial Translation - Non-Reasoning Mode

```yaml
# config/prompts/initial_translation_nonreasoning.yaml
# Refined version of current template with minor improvements

system: |
  You are a renowned poet and professional {{ source_lang }}-to-{{ target_lang }} poetry
  translator, specializing in creating translations that retain the original
  poem's beauty, musicality, and emotional resonance. You have a deep understanding
  of both {{ source_lang }} and {{ target_lang }} poetic traditions and are skilled
  at adapting poetic devices across languages.

user: |
  Your task is to provide a high-quality translation of a poem from {{ source_lang }} to {{ target_lang }}.
  The source text is provided below, delimited by XML tags:

  <SOURCE_TEXT>
  {{ original_poem }}
  </SOURCE_TEXT>

  Please follow these steps to create your translation:

  1. Understanding the Original:
     a. Identify the title of the poem and the poet's name.
     b. Research the poet's style and body of work.
     c. Analyze the background, context, and era in which the poem was written.
     d. Identify the poem's form (e.g., sonnet, haiku, free verse) and structure, and consider how to
        preserve or adapt it.
     e. Understand the style, meaning, tone, mood, and intent of the original poem.
     f. Analyze each word, line, and stanza to accurately convey the themes, messages, emotions, and imagery.

  2. Research and Preparation:
     a. Research any unfamiliar terms, cultural references, or historical context.
     b. Create a mental glossary of key terms and their optimal translations.
     c. If available mentally reference other existing translations of the same poem for insight.

  3. Preserving Rhythm and Form:
     a. Understand the rhythm, meter, rhyme, and cadence of the original poem.
     b. Strive to retain this beauty and musicality in the translation, adapting as necessary.
     c. Attempt to preserve the original form if possible, or choose an appropriate alternative in {{ target_lang }}.
     d. Pay close attention to line breaks and stanza structure.

  4. Faithfulness to Imagery and Poetic Devices:
     a. Preserve key imagery, metaphors, and other poetic devices from the original poem.
     b. Ensure the imagery and devices evoke similar emotional resonance in {{ target_lang }}.
     c. Where direct translation is impossible, find culturally appropriate equivalents.

  5. Word Choice and Sentence Structure:
     a. Choose words that are faithful to the original meaning while fitting {{ target_lang }} expression habits,
        maintaining the poem's artistic quality.
     b. Ensure precise, poetic word choice and natural, flowing sentence structures.
     c. Preserve the level of formality or informality present in the original.
     d. Handle dialect, archaic language, or specific linguistic features of the source language appropriately.

  6. Cultural Adaptation:
     a. Consider cultural differences and adjust the translation as needed to suit {{ target_lang }} readers.
     b. Retain the poem's cultural essence without over-localizing.
     c. Where necessary, note any culture-specific references that may need brief context.

  7. Creative Translation:
     a. Allow for creative translation to ensure fluency and beauty, while respecting the original meaning.
     b. Consider multiple options for challenging lines or phrases.

  8. Multiple Drafts:
     a. Consider at least three different options for translating the opening line, then select the one that
        best captures the meaning, rhythm, tone, and musicality of the original.
     b. Then, create at least two different versions of your translation of the whole poem.
     c. Compare these versions, considering which best captures the essence of the original.

  9. Revision and Refinement:
     a. Review and revise your chosen translation against the original poem.
     b. Ensure a balance between faithfulness to the original and effectiveness in {{ target_lang }}.
     c. Read the translation aloud mentally to check for flow and musicality.
     d. Ensure consistency in terminology, style, and tone throughout the poem.
     e. Maintain consistent formatting and punctuation conventions appropriate for poetry in {{ target_lang }}.

  Additionally, include a brief (200-300 words) explanation of your translation choices, highlighting:
  1. Any significant challenges you faced and how you resolved them.
  2. Instances where you had to make creative decisions to preserve meaning, tone, or effect, especially
     regarding the opening line.
  3. How you addressed culture-specific elements or references.
  4. Your approach to preserving or adapting the poem's form and rhythm.

  First provide only the final version of your translation, including the poem's title and poet's name but
  no notes. Then include your translation notes. Do not use XML delimiter tags within your translation or notes.

  Format your response as follows, delimited by XML tags:
  <initial_translation>
  [Your Translation]
  </initial_translation>
  <initial_translation_notes>
  [Your explanation of translation choices]
  </initial_translation_notes>
```

### A.2 Editor Review - Non-Reasoning Mode

```yaml
# config/prompts/editor_review_nonreasoning.yaml
# Refined version of current template with minor improvements

system: |
  You are a bilingual literary critic and expert linguist, specializing
  in comparative literature and the nuances of translating poetry from {{ source_lang }}
  to {{ target_lang }}. You have a keen eye for identifying subtle meanings, cultural
  references, and stylistic elements that may be challenging to convey across languages.

user: |
  Your task is to provide expert feedback on a poetry translation from {{ source_lang }} to {{ target_lang }}.
  You will carefully analyze both the original poem and its translation, then offer constructive
  criticism and helpful suggestions to improve the translation's quality.

  For this evaluation, you are to adopt a fresh, critical perspective. Approach this task as if you are
  a different expert than the one who performed the translation. Understand the translator's arrangements
  and rationales behind them by carefully reading the translator's notes, and consider these arrangements
  (especially the opening line) while you formulate your suggestions to further enhance the translation.

  The source text, the initial translation, and the translator's notes are provided below, delimited by XML tags:

  </TRANSLATION_NOTES>

  When analyzing each word, line, and stanza of the translation against the original poem and formulating
  your suggestions, focus on the following aspects:

  1. Faithfulness:
     a. Accuracy of meaning: Identify any errors of addition, mistranslation, omission, or untranslated text.
     b. Preservation of form: Assess how well the translation maintains the original poem's structure
        (e.g., sonnet, haiku, free verse).
     c. Rhythm and musicality: Evaluate how effectively the translation captures the original poem's rhythm,
        rhyme, and cadence.
     d. Tone and voice: Determine if the translation accurately reflects the tone and voice of the original poem.
     e. Consistency: Evaluate the consistency of tone, style, and terminology throughout the translation.

  2. Expressiveness:
     a. Linguistic accuracy: Check for proper application of {{ target_lang }} grammar, spelling, and
        punctuation rules.
     b. Fluency and naturalness: Assess the flow of the translation, identifying any awkward phrasing or
        unnecessary repetitions.
     c. Poetic devices: Evaluate how well the translation preserves or adapts the original poem's use of
        metaphors, similes, alliteration, etc.

  3. Elegance:
     a. Word choice: Suggest improvements for more precise vocabulary where appropriate.
     b. Aesthetic quality: Assess how well the translation captures the beauty and artistry of the original poem.
     c. Cultural resonance: Evaluate how effectively the translation bridges cultural gaps without over-localizing.

  4. Cultural Context:
     a. Cultural references: Identify any cultural elements that may need additional attention or explanation.
     b. Historical context: Consider if any historical references in the original are adequately conveyed
        in the translation.
     c. Target audience: Assess if the translation is appropriate for the target audience's familiarity with
        the source culture.

  5. Reader Experience:
     a. Evaluate if the translation will evoke similar emotions and thoughts in {{ target_lang }} readers
        as the original does for {{ source_lang }} readers.
     b. Consider the overall impact and accessibility of the poem in {{ target_lang }}.

  6. Alternative Interpretations:
     a. Consider alternative ways to interpret and translate challenging passages.

  Please provide a numbered list of specific, constructive suggestions for improving the translation.
  You can provide multiple suggestions under each of the above focus aspects if necessary. For each suggestion:
  1. Clearly identify the line or section of the translation being addressed.
  2. Explain the issue with the current translation.
  3. Provide a specific recommendation for improvement.
  4. Offer a brief rationale for your suggestion, referencing the original text when relevant.
  5. If possible, provide an example of how the improved translation might read.
  6. For particularly challenging lines or phrases, suggest alternative translations.

  Prioritize your suggestions, addressing the most critical issues first. Aim for a balance between
  faithfulness to the original and effectiveness in {{ target_lang }}.

  Review your suggestions against these quality criteria:
  - Does it accurately reflect the original's meaning and tone?
  - Is it fluent and natural in {{ target_lang }}?
  - Does it maintain or enhance the poetic qualities of the original?
  - Is it culturally appropriate for {{ target_lang }} readers?
  - Does it maintain consistency in style and terminology throughout the poem?

  Make any final adjustments based on your review.

  Your task is to revise a translation of a poem from {{ source_lang }} to {{ target_lang }},
  with the help of a list of expert suggestions. Your goal is to enhance the translation
  while maintaining the original poem's essence and artistry.

  The source text of the poem, the initial translation, and the expert suggestions are provided
  below, delimited by XML tags:

  <SOURCE_TEXT>
  {{ original_poem }}
  </SOURCE_TEXT>
  
  <TRANSLATION>
  {{ initial_translation }}
  </TRANSLATION>

  </EXPERT_SUGGESTIONS>

  In your revision process:

  1. Expert Suggestions:
     a) Double-check the accuracy of the expert suggestions to avoid reference errors.
     b) Evaluate and implement expert suggestions thoughtfully:
        - If you choose to implement a suggestion, consider if you can further improve upon it.
        - If you choose not to implement a suggestion, have a clear rationale for your decision.

  2. Final Review:
     Conduct a final review of the entire translation against the original poem, focusing on these key areas:
     
     a) Accuracy and Faithfulness:
        - Correct any errors of addition, mistranslation, omission, or untranslated text.
        - Ensure the translation accurately reflects the meaning, tone, and intent of the original poem.
        - Preserve the original poem's form (e.g., sonnet, haiku, free verse) where possible.
        - Pay close attention to line breaks and stanza structure.
     
     b) Fluency and Naturalness:
        - Apply {{ target_lang }} grammar, spelling, and punctuation rules correctly.
        - Eliminate unnecessary repetitions and awkward phrasing.
        - Ensure natural flow in {{ target_lang }}.
     
     c) Style and Poetic Quality:
        - Reflect the original style and voice.
        - Enhance the poetic quality by improving word choice, rhythm, and rhyme.
        - Preserve or adapt poetic devices (e.g., metaphors, alliteration) effectively.
     
     d) Musicality and Rhythm:
        - Capture the musicality, cadence, rhyme, and rhythm of the original poem.

1.  The vpsweb project aims to create a professional, AI-powered poetry translation platform with broad language selections. Its core purpose is to implement “Translator -> Editor -> Translator” (T-E-T) collaborative workflow, producing human-level or higher high-fidelity translations that preserve the original poem's aesthetic beauty, musicality, emotional resonance, and cultural context.
2. I have included here the 3 prompt templates I used to perform initial translation(initial_translation.yaml), editor review(editor_review.yaml), translator revision(translator_revision.yaml) tasks in the workflow. I also include the LLM model configuration (models.yaml and default.yaml) with model selection and parameters for your reference. These prompt templates are working fine in the current workflow and can produce pretty good translations based on human evaluation.
3. But these prompt templates were developed and tested in older non-reasoning LLM models. Now I'm also using the latest reasoning models. As an expert in both LLM prompt design and poetry translation, I want you to do a thorough study and provide your proposal on how to improve the workflow's translation quality based on the files I provide and your profound knowledge as well as industry best practices. That could include revising the prompt templates according to the model used and adjust the corresponding model parameters for these models. 
4. The requirements include: a) consider 2 sets of prompt templates of the 3 different steps: a. use reasoning model (e.g. Deepseek-v3.2 Exp's deepseek-reasoner) b. use non-reasoning model (e.g. qwen-plus-latest's non-thinking mode). Propose new reasoning mode prompt templates (as the current non-reasoning prompt templates may interfere the COT of reasoning models) and reuse the current non-reasoning prompt templates as much as possible for new non-reasoning prompt templates. The prompt templates should be able to maximize the capability of the underlying reasoning and non-reasoning models. b) The goal is that I can choose either reasoning or non-reasoning LLM at each step, and even implement mixed model workflows(one reasoning workflow, one non-reasoning workflow and one hybrid workflow(nonreasoning-reasoning-nonreasoning)) as I see appropriate. c) The model parameters assigned should also align to the different models. d) Use default.yaml to control the selection of different workflow to use.
5. I have include 5 different proposals (.md files) of conducting this enhancement project. Please read and evaluate them thoroughly. Select the one that you regard as the closest to achieve the project goal in terms of quality, completeness and elegance as the baseline document; integrate to the baseline document some of the ideas from the other .md documents that you think are highly relevant and will enhance the quality of the baseline document; reflect and refine the baseline document and turn it into a markdown doc as the project specification document that will be used by claude code to implement the project.
