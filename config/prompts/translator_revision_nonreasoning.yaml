  Your task is to revise a translation of a poem from {{ source_lang }} to {{ target_lang }},
  with the help of a list of expert suggestions. Your goal is to enhance the translation
  while maintaining the original poem's essence and artistry.

  The source text of the poem, the initial translation, and the expert suggestions are provided
  below, delimited by XML tags:

  <ORIGINAL_POEM_INFO>
  Title: {{ poem_title }}
  Poet: {{ poet_name }}
  </ORIGINAL_POEM_INFO>

  <INITIAL_TRANSLATION_INFO>
  Translated Title: {{ translated_poem_title }}
  Translated Poet: {{ translated_poet_name }}
  </INITIAL_TRANSLATION_INFO>

  <SOURCE_TEXT>
  {{ original_poem }}
  </SOURCE_TEXT>

  <TRANSLATION>
  {{ initial_translation }}
  </TRANSLATION>

  <EXPERT_SUGGESTIONS>
  {{ editor_suggestions }}
  </EXPERT_SUGGESTIONS>

  In your revision process:

  1. Expert Suggestions:
  a) Double check the accuracy of the expert suggestions, avoid reference errors
  b) Evaluate and implement expert suggestions.
  - If you choose to implement a suggestion, think about if you can further improve the suggestion.
  - If you choose not to implement a suggestion, have a clear rationale for your decision.

  2. Final Review:
  Conduct a final review of the entire translation, against the original poem, focusing on these key areas:

  a) Accuracy and Faithfulness:
  - Correct any errors of addition, mistranslation, omission, or untranslated text
  - Ensure the translation accurately reflects the meaning, tone, and intent of the original poem
  - Preserve the original poem's form (e.g., sonnet, haiku, free verse) where possible.
  - Pay close attention to line breaks and stanza structure.

  b) Fluency and Naturalness:
  - Apply {{ target_lang }} grammar, spelling, and punctuation rules correctly.
  - Eliminate unnecessary repetitions and awkward phrasing.
  - Ensure natural flow in {{ target_lang }}

  c) Style and Poetic Quality:
  - Reflect the original style and voice
  - Enhance the poetic quality by improving word choice, rhythm, and rhyme
  - Preserve or adapt poetic devices (e.g., metaphors, alliteration) effectively

  d) Musicality and Rhythm:
  - Capture the musicality, cadence, rhyme and rhythm of the original poem.
  - If the original has a specific rhyme scheme, strive to preserve it or find an effective alternative

  e) Cultural Context:
  - Address any cultural references or nuances appropriately for {{ target_lang }} readers
  - Avoid over-localization while ensuring the poem resonates with the target audience

  f) Consistency:
  - Ensure consistency in terminology, style, and tone throughout the translation.
  - Maintain consistent formatting and punctuation conventions appropriate for poetry in {{ target_lang }}.

  3. Final Refinement
  a. Based on the result of your final review, make any additional improvements you deem absolute necessary, even if not suggested by experts.
  b. Read the revised translation aloud to check for rhythm and flow. Make any final adjustments based on your review.

  Please provide your revised translation, followed by an explanation in Chinese of the changes you made and why. Include:
  1. Major revisions and the reasoning behind them.
  2. Any significant expert suggestions you chose not to implement and why.
  3. How you balanced preserving the original poem's essence with making it effective in {{ target_lang }}.
  4. Any particular challenges you faced and how you resolved them.
