# MCP Tools Usage - Personal Commitment

## üéØ My Commitment

I commit to proactively using Context7 and other MCP tools without reminders, building automatic habits through consistent practice.

## üî¥ Automatic Habits - Build Through Repetition

### **Habit 1: Documentation First**
**Trigger**: Starting ANY new implementation
**Automatic Response**: Use Context7 immediately
**Mental Mantra**: *"New implementation = Context7 first"*

### **Habit 2: Research Before Coding**
**Trigger**: ANY brainstorming or technical decision
**Automatic Response**: Research with Context7 + GitHub Search
**Mental Mantra**: *"Brainstorming = research first"*

### **Habit 3: Troubleshoot with Documentation**
**Trigger**: ANY technical problem or error
**Automatic Response**: Context7 + GitHub Search for solutions
**Mental Mantra**: *"Problem = documentation research"*

### **Habit 4: Examples Before Implementation**
**Trigger**: Implementing ANY pattern or approach
**Automatic Response**: GitHub Search for examples first
**Mental Mantra**: *"Pattern implementation = find examples"*

## üõë STOP AND THINK Checklist

**Before starting ANY task, I will ask myself:**

1. **Am I implementing something new?**
   - YES ‚Üí Use Context7 immediately
   - NO ‚Üí Continue to next question

2. **Am I solving a technical problem?**
   - YES ‚Üí Use Context7 + GitHub Search immediately
   - NO ‚Üí Continue to next question

3. **Am I making architectural decisions?**
   - YES ‚Üí Use Context7 + DeepWiki immediately
   - NO ‚Üí Continue to next question

4. **Am I working with files?**
   - YES ‚Üí Use Filesystem tools
   - NO ‚Üí Continue to next question

5. **Am I doing GitHub operations?**
   - YES ‚Üí Use GitHub tools
   - NO ‚Üí Continue to next question

6. **Am I working on web UI?**
   - YES ‚Üí Use Chrome DevTools
   - NO ‚Üí Proceed with task

## üìã Success Criteria

### **Daily Success Metrics**
- ‚úÖ Used Context7 before implementing any new library/framework
- ‚úÖ Researched technical problems with documentation before solving
- ‚úÖ Found and referenced examples for pattern implementations
- ‚úÖ Documented research sources in my work
- ‚úÖ Did not need user reminders for MCP tool usage

### **Weekly Self-Assessment Questions**
1. **Did I remember to use MCP tools proactively?** (Yes/No)
2. **Which situations did I forget to use tools?** (List specific instances)
3. **What documentation was most valuable this week?** (List specific sources)
4. **How did MCP tools accelerate my development?** (Specific examples)
5. **What habits do I need to strengthen?** (Identify weak areas)

## üîß Habit Building Strategy

### **Week 1-2: Deliberate Practice**
- Be extremely conscious of tool usage
- Use tools even for small tasks
- Document every tool usage decision
- Review tool usage daily

### **Week 3-4: Building Automaticity**
- Practice mental checklist before every task
- Focus on automatic triggers
- Reduce conscious effort, increase automatic response
- Continue daily documentation

### **Week 5-6: Solidification**
- Tools should feel automatic and natural
- Focus on edge cases and complex scenarios
- Share successful patterns with others
- Refine triggers based on experience

### **Week 7-8: Mastery**
- Tool usage should be completely automatic
- Focus on helping others develop similar habits
- Document best practices and insights
- Mentor others in proactive tool usage

## üéØ Specific Scenarios & Automatic Responses

### **Scenario: FastAPI Implementation**
**Automatic Response**:
1. Context7 for FastAPI documentation
2. GitHub Search for FastAPI examples
3. Research best practices before coding
4. Document sources used

### **Scenario: Database Schema Design**
**Automatic Response**:
1. Context7 for SQLAlchemy patterns
2. DeepWiki for similar project architectures
3. GitHub Search for schema examples
4. Document architectural decisions

### **Scenario: Security Implementation**
**Automatic Response**:
1. Context7 for security best practices
2. GitHub Search for security implementations
3. Research common vulnerabilities and protections
4. Document security decisions with sources

### **Scenario: Testing Strategy**
**Automatic Response**:
1. Context7 for testing frameworks and patterns
2. GitHub Search for testing examples
3. Research testing best practices
4. Document testing approach with sources

## üìà Progress Tracking

### **Tool Usage Log Template**
For each week, I will track:
- **Context7 Usage Count**: Number of times Context7 was used
- **GitHub Search Count**: Number of GitHub searches performed
- **Research Quality**: Value of documentation found (1-5 scale)
- **Automatic Response Rate**: How often I used tools automatically
- **User Reminders Needed**: Number of times I needed reminders (should be 0)

### **Success Indicators**
- **Week 1-2**: 80% automatic tool usage, some conscious effort required
- **Week 3-4**: 90% automatic tool usage, minimal conscious effort
- **Week 5-6**: 95% automatic tool usage, feels natural
- **Week 7-8**: 99% automatic tool usage, completely habitual

## üîÑ Continuous Improvement

### **Monthly Review**
- Analyze tool usage patterns
- Identify areas for improvement
- Update automatic triggers based on experience
- Share insights with team members

### **Pattern Recognition**
- Identify situations where I consistently forget tools
- Create stronger automatic triggers for those situations
- Build mental associations between triggers and tool usage
- Document successful patterns for future reference

## üéâ Celebration of Success
