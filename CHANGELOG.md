### Next Steps (Post-Checkpoint)

1. **DeepSeek API Resolution**: Investigate and resolve HTTP response hanging issue
2. **Additional Provider Support**: Add support for more LLM providers
3. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize token usage and response times
4. **Batch Processing**: Add support for multiple poem processing
5. **Caching Layer**: Implement response caching for repeated inputs
6. **Advanced Configuration**: Add more granular configuration options
7. **Testing Suite**: Comprehensive automated testing implementation
8. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment pipeline

### Technical Debt

- HTTP client timeout handling could be more sophisticated
- Configuration validation could be enhanced
- Error messages could be more user-friendly
- Additional unit and integration tests needed
- Performance benchmarking not yet implemented
