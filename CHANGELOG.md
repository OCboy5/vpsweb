## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Complete 3-step Translator→Editor→Translator workflow implementation
- XML-based structured output parsing for all workflow steps
- Comprehensive error handling and retry logic with exponential backoff
- Per-step token usage tracking and cost monitoring
- Production-ready logging with structured output and file rotation
- CLI interface with detailed progress reporting and status updates
- Python API for programmatic access and integration
- Environment variable configuration with `.env` file support
- Modular provider architecture supporting multiple LLM services

### Fixed
- Unicode encoding issue in `src/vpsweb/__init__.py` that prevented module imports
- LLMFactory initialization with missing provider configuration parameters
- Method signature mismatches in executor method calls
- Data flow issues between workflow steps
- HTTP client hanging issues with DeepSeek API responses
- Missing required fields in Pydantic data models
- XML tag parsing and structured data extraction

### Changed
- Switched editor review step from DeepSeek to Tongyi due to response parsing compatibility
- Updated all workflow steps to use proper XML delimiters for structured output
- Improved error messages and debugging information throughout the application
- Enhanced token usage reporting with per-step breakdown
- Optimized HTTP request handling with timeout management

### Technical Details

#### Core Components Implemented

**Workflow Engine (`src/vpsweb/core/workflow.py`)**
- `TranslationWorkflow` class orchestrating the complete 3-step process
- Step-by-step execution with proper error handling and rollback
- Result aggregation with comprehensive metadata tracking

**Step Executor (`src/vpsweb/core/executor.py`)**
- Modular step execution with provider-specific configurations
- XML parsing for structured LLM responses
- Comprehensive logging of all LLM interactions (prompts, responses, parsed output)
- Retry logic with configurable attempts and exponential backoff

**LLM Services (`src/vpsweb/services/llm/`)**
- `OpenAICompatibleProvider` for unified API handling across providers
- Provider factory with caching and configuration management
- HTTP client optimization with proper timeout handling
- Support for multiple providers (Tongyi, DeepSeek, etc.)

**Data Models (`src/vpsweb/models/translation.py`)**
- `TranslationInput` - Structured input for workflow execution
- `InitialTranslation` - Results from initial translation step with XML parsing
- `EditorReview` - Structured editor feedback with suggestions extraction
- `RevisedTranslation` - Final translation incorporating editorial feedback
- Complete workflow result model with comprehensive metadata

**CLI Interface (`src/vpsweb/__main__.py`)**
- Full-featured command-line interface with rich progress reporting
- Support for file input, stdin, and various output formats
- Detailed logging and error reporting
- Environment variable configuration support

#### Known Issues & Workarounds

1. **DeepSeek API Response Hanging**
   - **Issue**: HTTP client hangs when reading DeepSeek API responses
   - **Workaround**: Use Tongyi provider for editor review step
   - **Status**: Documented, workaround implemented

2. **Source Layout PYTHONPATH Requirement**
   - **Issue**: Python src layout requires PYTHONPATH for module imports
   - **Workaround**: Set `PYTHONPATH=src` when running commands
   - **Status**: Documented, installation instructions updated
