### Technical Details

#### Core Components Implemented

**Workflow Engine (`src/vpsweb/core/workflow.py`)**
- `TranslationWorkflow` class orchestrating the complete 3-step process
- Step-by-step execution with proper error handling and rollback
- Result aggregation with comprehensive metadata tracking

**Step Executor (`src/vpsweb/core/executor.py`)**
- Modular step execution with provider-specific configurations
- XML parsing for structured LLM responses
- Comprehensive logging of all LLM interactions (prompts, responses, parsed output)
- Retry logic with configurable attempts and exponential backoff

**LLM Services (`src/vpsweb/services/llm/`)**
- `OpenAICompatibleProvider` for unified API handling across providers
- Provider factory with caching and configuration management
- HTTP client optimization with proper timeout handling
- Support for multiple providers (Tongyi, DeepSeek, etc.)

**Data Models (`src/vpsweb/models/translation.py`)**
