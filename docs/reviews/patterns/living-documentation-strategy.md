# Living Documentation Strategy

## Core Principle

**Update documentation when you learn something, not later.**

## Simple Rules

### 1. Document When You Learn
- Update docs when you discover a better approach
- Add examples when implementing features
- Note problems and solutions immediately

### 2. Keep It Actionable  
- Focus on "what to do" not just "what we did"
- Include working code examples and commands
- Write for problem-solving, not just reference

### 3. Review Quarterly
- Remove outdated information immediately
- Consolidate related insights when patterns emerge
- Keep only what's actually useful

## What This Looks Like

- **VPSWeb**: Each major release updated docs with lessons learned
- **Reviews**: Capture insights immediately after project completion
- **Patterns**: Consolidate related learnings into reusable documents

## Success Metrics

- Documentation actually gets used during development
- New team members can find answers quickly
- Insights from one project help with the next one

**Keep it simple, keep it useful, keep it current.**
