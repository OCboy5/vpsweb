# VPSWeb Project Reviews Index

## Overview
This index provides searchable access to all project reviews conducted using the Strategy-Todo-Code-Review Process. Reviews are organized by decision type, complexity, and applicability for easy reference.

## Review Categories

### üèóÔ∏è Architectural Reviews
**Reviews of major structural and design decisions that affect the entire system architecture.**

## Key Patterns Identified

### Architectural Patterns
- **Provider Abstraction**: Essential for external service dependencies
- **Modular Service Layer**: Clean separation of concerns pays dividends
- **Configuration-Driven Design**: Enables flexibility but requires validation

### Process Patterns
- **PSD-Driven Development**: High-quality specification documents drive systematic development
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start simple, add complexity based on usage
- **User Feedback Integration**: Real-world usage should drive priorities
- **Release Discipline**: Systematic release processes maintain quality

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- **Architecture Over UX**: Don't prioritize developer convenience over user experience
- **API Assumptions**: Never assume external APIs work as documented
- **Deferred Testing**: Automated testing should be implemented from beginning

## Using This Index

### For New Projects
1. **Search by Project Type**: Find reviews applicable to your project domain
2. **Review Strategic Decisions**: Understand what worked and what didn't in similar contexts
3. **Apply Proven Patterns**: Use high-confidence insights to inform your strategy
4. **Avoid Known Anti-Patterns**: Check relevant reviews for pitfalls to avoid

### For Strategy Phase
1. **Search Historical Context**: Look for reviews of similar decision types
2. **Extract Key Insights**: Use "Always Do" and "Never Do" sections
3. **Consider Applicability**: Adapt insights to your specific context
4. **Document Learning Gaps**: Note what existing reviews don't cover

### For Process Improvement
1. **Meta-Analysis**: Look for patterns across multiple reviews
2. **Process Reviews**: Check for insights about Strategy-Todo-Code-Review process itself
3. **Update Based on Experience**: Add new insights as you validate or refute existing ones

## Maintaining This Index

### Adding New Reviews
1. Categorize under appropriate section
2. Update key patterns if new insights emerge
3. Update search templates with new tags
4. Link related reviews using `relates_to` field

### Updating Existing Reviews
1. Add validation notes as insights are applied
2. Update confidence levels as patterns are proven
3. Mark superseded reviews when consolidated
4. Maintain version history for major updates
