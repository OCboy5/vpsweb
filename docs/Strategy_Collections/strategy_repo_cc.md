# Strategy: Personal Repository System with Web UI

**Project**: VPSWeb Personal Repository and WebUI
**Version**: v0.1 - Personal Prototype
**Date**: 2025-10-19
**Author**: Claude Code

## 1. Executive Summary

This strategy outlines the development of a **personal repository system with web UI** for VPSWeb poetry translations. The goal is to create a **simple, functional prototype** for personal use that can later scale to production-level features.

**Key Decision**: We will build a SQLite-based system with a minimal web interface, leveraging existing database infrastructure while keeping complexity manageable.

## 2. Current State Analysis

### 2.1 Existing Infrastructure
- **Database Layer**: Comprehensive SQLAlchemy models in `src/vpsweb/repository/database/`
- **Configuration**: YAML-based config system with `config/repository.yaml`
- **Repository Pattern**: Well-defined repository abstraction layer
- **Background Tasks**: Robust task management system
- **Web Framework**: FastAPI foundation ready for extension

### 2.2 Current Challenges
- **Over-engineering**: Existing system is designed for enterprise use
- **Complexity**: Too many features for personal deployment
- **Web UI Gap**: Missing user interface for data interaction
- **Focus Mismatch**: Current system optimized for multi-user scenarios

### 2.3 Personal Use Requirements
- **Simple Deployment**: Single machine, localhost access
- **Core Features**: View poems, manage translations, basic comparisons
- **Low Maintenance**: Minimal operational overhead
- **Immediate Value**: Tangible benefits for daily translation work

## 3. Brainstorming: Implementation Approaches

### 3.1 Approach 1: Simplified Single-File Repository
**Description**: JSON/YAML files with minimal structure

**Pros**:
- Extremely simple implementation
- No database dependencies
- Easy backup and migration
