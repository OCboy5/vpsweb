# CC Tips
1. Tell it to create a plan first 2. Actually review then plan and iterate on it 3. Ask it to optimize the plan for parallelizing and acting as a manager for complex and large changes 4. Ask it to review its own work for bugs / issues / etc. 

Have it create a plan, then have chatpgt review the plan, and then have claude review the review, and go back and forth until they agree or you step in and decide. After it implements the plan, have the other ai review the work and see if it completed the plan properly.
