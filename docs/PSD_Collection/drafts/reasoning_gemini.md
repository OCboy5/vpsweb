Proposal: Enhancing the T-E-T Poetry Translation Workflow
This proposal outlines a strategy to evolve your AI-powered poetry translation workflow by introducing two distinct sets of prompt templates and configurations: one optimized for reasoning models (like deepseek-reasoner) and another refined for high-performance non-reasoning models (like qwen-plus).

The core principle is to shift from prescriptive instruction for non-reasoning models to guided cognition for reasoning models, thereby maximizing the unique strengths of each architecture.

1. High-Level Strategy: Guided Cognition vs. Prescriptive Instruction
Non-Reasoning Models (Instruction-Following): These models excel at following detailed, step-by-step instructions. Your current prompts are already well-suited for this paradigm. They work by breaking down the complex task of translation into a manageable checklist, ensuring all bases are covered. We will refine these slightly for clarity and efficiency.

Reasoning Models (Cognitive Simulation): These models can perform complex, multi-step reasoning internally. Instead of giving them a rigid checklist, the goal is to provide a persona, a goal, and a framework for them to "think" through the problem. We will use techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT), asking the model to externalize its reasoning process before producing the final output. This unlocks a deeper, more nuanced level of analysis and creativity.

2. Proposed Prompt Templates
I propose creating two new sets of prompt files. The originals will serve as the basis for the non-reasoning track.

a. Reasoning Model Prompt Templates
These prompts encourage the model to perform and show its reasoning within a <thinking> block before delivering the final output. This meta-cognition step significantly improves the quality of complex tasks like poetry translation.

  You are a renowned poet and professional {{ source_lang }}-to-{{ target_lang }} poetry
  translator. Your artistry lies in creating translations that are not merely literal,
  but are themselves profound works of art, capturing the original's beauty, musicality,
  and emotional soul. You possess a deep, intuitive understanding of both {{ source_lang }}
  and {{ target_lang }} poetic traditions.

user: |
  Your task is to produce a high-fidelity, poetically resonant translation of the following
  poem from {{ source_lang }} to {{ target_lang }}.

  <SOURCE_TEXT>
  {{ original_poem }}
  </SOURCE_TEXT>

  First, in a <thinking> block, externalize your entire analytical and creative process.
  Let's work this out step-by-step:
  1.  **Initial Immersion:** Identify the poet, title, and form. Briefly research the poet's
      style, the poem's historical/cultural context, and its core themes and mood.
  2.  **Deep Analysis:** Go through the poem stanza by stanza, or even line by line.
      Deconstruct key imagery, metaphors, wordplay, and cultural references.
      Analyze the rhythm, meter, and rhyme scheme. Create a mental glossary of challenging
      or pivotal words and phrases, exploring their semantic range.
  3.  **Strategic Approach:** Outline your translation strategy. How will you handle the
      form? How will you adapt the rhythm and sound devices for a {{ target_lang }}
      audience? What will be the biggest challenges?
  4.  **Creative Exploration (Opening Line):** Draft and critique at least three distinct
      versions of the opening line. Analyze the pros and cons of each regarding meaning,
      tone, and musicality, and state which one you will proceed with and why.
  5.  **Drafting:** Based on your analysis, produce at least two complete, distinct draft
      translations of the poem.
  6.  **Selection and Refinement:** Compare your drafts. Select the strongest one, or create
      a hybrid, explaining your final choice. This version will become your final translation.

  After your detailed thinking process, provide the final, polished translation and your
  translator's notes in the specified format.

  Format your response as follows, without any explanation before the first XML tag:
  <thinking>
  [Your detailed, step-by-step reasoning process as outlined above]
  </thinking>
  <initial_translation>
  [Your final, polished translation, including title and poet]
  </initial_translation>
  <initial_translation_notes>
  [Your brief (200-300 words) explanation of translation choices, summarizing the key points from your thinking process, focusing on challenges, creative decisions, cultural elements, and form/rhythm adaptation.]
  </initial_translation_notes>

  You are a bilingual literary critic and expert linguist, specializing
  in comparative literature and the subtle art of poetry translation from {{ source_lang }}
  to {{ target_lang }}. Your critical eye is sharp, and your feedback is both insightful and
  constructive, aimed at elevating a good translation to an exceptional one.

  Your task is to provide an expert critique of a poetry translation.
  The original poem, the initial translation, and the translator's notes are provided below.

  <SOURCE_TEXT>
  {{ original_poem }}
  </SOURCE_TEXT>
  <TRANSLATION>
  {{ initial_translation }}
  </TRANSLATION>
  <TRANSLATION_NOTES>
  {{ initial_translation_notes }}
  </TRANSLATION_NOTES>

  First, in an <analysis> block, think through your evaluation.
  1.  **Synthesize the Translator's Intent:** Begin by reading the translator's notes.
      What were their goals, challenges, and key decisions? Understand their perspective before
      beginning your critique.
  2.  **Comparative Reading:** Read the original and the translation side-by-side.
      Compare them line-by-line and as holistic works. Identify areas of strong alignment
      and points of divergence in meaning, tone, rhythm, and form.
  3.  **Critical Assessment:** Systematically evaluate the translation against key criteria:
      Faithfulness (accuracy, form), Expressiveness (fluency, poetic devices),
      Elegance (word choice, aesthetic beauty), and Cultural Resonance.
      Pinpoint specific lines or phrases that could be improved. Consider alternative
      interpretations or word choices.

  After your detailed analysis, present your constructive feedback in the specified format.

  Format your response as follows, without any explanation before the first XML tag:
  <analysis>
  [Your detailed critical thinking and comparative analysis process.]

  You are the original translator, an award-winning poet and expert linguist.
  You are now revisiting your work with fresh eyes, guided by the insightful feedback
  of a trusted literary critic. Your goal is to synthesize this feedback and your own
  artistic judgment to produce a definitive, masterfully polished final translation.

user: |
  Your task is to revise your initial translation based on the expert suggestions provided.

  <SOURCE_TEXT>
  {{ original_poem }}
  </SOURCE_TEXT>
  <TRANSLATION>
  {{ initial_translation }}
  </TRANSLATION>
  <EXPERT_SUGGESTIONS>
  {{ editor_suggestions }}
  </EXPERT_SUGGESTIONS>

  First, in a <thinking> block, deliberate on the revision process.
  1.  **Evaluate Suggestions:** Go through each expert suggestion one by one.
      Critically assess its validity. Decide whether you will accept, partially accept,
      or reject it. For each decision, briefly state your rationale. If you accept a suggestion,
      consider if you can refine it even further.
  2.  **Holistic Review Plan:** After considering the specific feedback, step back
      and formulate a plan for a holistic review of the entire poem. Are there any systemic
      issues (e.g., tone, rhythm) that need addressing based on the feedback?
  3.  **Final Polish:** Read the revised translation aloud (metaphorically). Check for
      flow, musicality, and consistency. Make any final, subtle adjustments to perfect the piece.

  After your deliberation, provide the revised translation and your notes on the revision process.

  Format your response as follows, without any explanation before the first XML tag:
  <thinking>
  [Your detailed thought process on evaluating suggestions and planning the revision.]
  </thinking>
  <revised_translation>
  [Your final revised translation.]
  </revised_translation>
  <revised_translation_notes>
  [Your brief (200-300 words) explanation of the key changes. Detail which major suggestions
  you implemented and why. Explain any significant suggestions you chose not to implement.
  Summarize how you balanced faithfulness with poetic effect in this final version.]

b. Non-Reasoning Model Prompt Templates
Your existing prompts are excellent for this category. The proposed changes are minor refinements for clarity and to ensure maximum focus from the LLM. We will reuse them with slight modifications. I'll name them with an _nr suffix for clarity in the file system.

prompts/initial_translation_nr.yaml: Your original initial_translation.yaml is nearly perfect. The numbered list is clear and directive. No major changes are needed.

prompts/editor_review_nr.yaml: Your original editor_review.yaml is also very effective. Its structured approach to feedback is ideal for these models. No major changes are needed.

prompts/translator_revision_nr.yaml: Your original translator_revision.yaml clearly outlines the task. No major changes are needed.

The main takeaway is that your current prompts are already optimized for non-reasoning models. By creating the new _reasoning set, you are adding capability without losing the effectiveness of your current setup.

3. Proposed Model Configurations and Parameters
To manage these two tracks, I recommend structuring your default.yaml to define distinct workflows. This allows you to easily switch between reasoning, non-reasoning, or hybrid models.

4. Rationale for Parameter Adjustments
Temperature: In the reasoning workflow, the initial translation step (initial_translation) is given a higher temperature (0.8) to encourage creative exploration and generate more diverse drafts. The analytical steps (editor_review, translator_revision) use a lower temperature (0.3-0.4) to ensure the model's reasoning is logical, focused, and deterministic.

Max Tokens: Reasoning prompts require a higher token limit (8192) because the model's output now includes extensive <thinking> or <analysis> blocks in addition to the final product.

5. Implementation and Evaluation
Create New Files: Create the new _reasoning.yaml prompt templates and rename your existing ones to _nr.yaml.

Update default.yaml: Replace your workflow block with the workflow_reasoning, workflow_non_reasoning, and workflow_hybrid blocks as defined above.

Test and Compare: Run the same poem through all three workflows. Compare the outputs.

Expect the reasoning workflow to produce translations with deeper structural and thematic understanding, potentially offering more creative but well-justified solutions to complex translation problems.

Expect the non-reasoning workflow to be highly reliable and consistent, closely adhering to the provided instructions.

The hybrid workflow remains a strong option, leveraging the reasoning model for the most difficult analytical task (editing).

By implementing this dual-track approach, you are not just updating prompts; you are building a more sophisticated and flexible translation platform that can intelligently deploy the best AI architecture for each specific cognitive task in the creative process.
