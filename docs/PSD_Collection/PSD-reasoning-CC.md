Vox Poetica Studio Web: Reasoning Model Optimization Specification
Executive Summary
This specification defines a comprehensive enhancement strategy for the VPS Web poetry translation workflow, introducing dual-mode prompt templates optimized for reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI o1/o3) and non-reasoning models (e.g., Qwen-Plus, GPT-4). The optimization enables three operational modes: pure reasoning, pure non-reasoning, and hybrid workflows, maximizing translation quality while maintaining flexibility.
1. Project Goals
Dual-Mode Support: Create specialized prompt templates for reasoning and non-reasoning models
Workflow Flexibility: Enable pure reasoning, pure non-reasoning, and hybrid workflows
Quality Enhancement: Leverage reasoning capabilities for complex poetry translation
Parameter Optimization: Tune model-specific parameters for optimal performance
Configuration Control: Use default.yaml for workflow selection
2. Model Architecture Analysis
2.1 Reasoning vs Non-Reasoning Models
Aspect	Reasoning Models	Non-Reasoning Models
Prompt Style	Minimal, direct, clear	Detailed, step-by-step guidance
Instructions	What to achieve	How to achieve it
Examples	Zero-shot preferred	Few-shot can help
CoT Prompting	Avoid (interference)	Beneficial
Temperature	0.1-0.3	0.2-0.7
Reasoning	Internal, automatic	Must be explicitly prompted
Max Tokens	Higher (8K-16K)	Moderate (4K-8K)
2.2 Optimization Principles
Reasoning Models:
Use minimal, clear prompts
Avoid explicit step-by-step instructions
Trust internal reasoning process
Lower temperature settings
Higher token budgets
Non-Reasoning Models:
Maintain detailed procedural guidance
Preserve step-by-step instructions
Moderate temperature settings
Standard token limits
3. Workflow Configurations
3.1 Three Workflow Modes
# Mode 1: Pure Reasoning Workflow (Optimal for complex poetry)
workflow_mode: "reasoning"
steps:
  initial_translation: reasoning
  editor_review: reasoning  
  translator_revision: reasoning

# Mode 2: Pure Non-Reasoning Workflow (Faster, cost-effective)
workflow_mode: "non_reasoning"
steps:
  initial_translation: non_reasoning
  editor_review: non_reasoning
  translator_revision: non_reasoning

# Mode 3: Hybrid Workflow (Balanced approach)
workflow_mode: "hybrid"
steps:
  initial_translation: non_reasoning    # Fast initial draft
  editor_review: reasoning              # Deep critical analysis
  translator_revision: non_reasoning    # Efficient refinement
3.2 Model Parameter Optimization
# Reasoning Model Parameters
reasoning_params:
  temperature: 0.2          # Lower for consistency
  max_tokens: 16384         # Higher for extended reasoning
  top_p: 0.95              # Maintain diversity
  timeout: 300.0           # Longer for reasoning time
  stop: ["</initial_translation_notes>", "</editor_suggestions>", "</revised_translation_notes>"]

# Non-Reasoning Model Parameters  
non_reasoning_params:
  temperature: 0.5-0.7     # Moderate for creativity
  max_tokens: 8192         # Standard range
  top_p: 0.9
  timeout: 180.0
  stop: ["</initial_translation_notes>", "</editor_suggestions>", "</revised_translation_notes>"]
