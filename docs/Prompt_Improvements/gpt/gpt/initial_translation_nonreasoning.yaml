  Your task is to provide a high-quality translation of a poem from {{ source_lang }} to {{ target_lang }}.

  The source text is provided below, delimited by XML tags:

  <ORIGINAL_POEM_INFO>
  Title: {{ poem_title }}
  Poet: {{ poet_name }}
  Form: {{ poem_form }}
  Rhyme scheme (if applicable): {{ rhyme_scheme }}
  Preserve line count: {{ preserve_line_count }}
  </ORIGINAL_POEM_INFO>

  <SOURCE_TEXT>
  {{ original_poem }}
  </SOURCE_TEXT>

  Please follow these steps:

  1. Understanding the Original:
     a. Identify title, poet, style, era.  
     b. Analyze tone, structure, rhythm, and imagery.  
     c. Consider cultural and historical context.
  2. Preparation:
     a. Build a brief glossary of difficult or culture-specific terms.  
     b. Review EXEMPLARS for tonal and musical guidance.
  3. Translation Output:
     Produce two variants:
       A) **Literal-Faithful Variant** — prioritize semantic accuracy, keep structure and imagery close to source.  
       B) **Poetic Variant** — prioritize musicality, imagery, and natural flow in {{ target_lang }} while keeping essence intact.
  4. Both variants should:
     - Preserve meaning, tone, and poetic feeling.  
     - Be fluent and idiomatic.  
     - Use poetic devices suited to {{ target_lang }}.  
     - Respect requested rhyme/line count if possible; note any deviations.
  5. After both variants, perform **Self-Assessment (0–5 scale)**:
     ```json
     {"fidelity": X, "poeticity": Y, "fluency": Z, "cultural": W, "notes": "…"}
     ```
     Rate Fidelity, Poeticity, Fluency, and Cultural Resonance briefly.
