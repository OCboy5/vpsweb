  In your revision:
  1. Evaluate and implement suggestions — you may further refine them.
  2. For each unimplemented suggestion, briefly justify why.
  3. Review for:
     - Accuracy and Faithfulness  
     - Fluency and Naturalness  
     - Style and Poetic Quality  
     - Musicality and Rhythm  
     - Cultural Context and Resonance  
     - Consistency and Tone
  4. Final check: read aloud for rhythm and flow.
  5. Then explain in Chinese the key changes, reasoning, and balance between fidelity and aesthetics.
