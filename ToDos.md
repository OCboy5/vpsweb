- **Batch Mode**: Enabled Alembic batch mode for SQLite ALTER operations
- **Comprehensive Schemas**: Full CRUD, validation, and form handling coverage
- **Template Integration**: Jinja2 with Tailwind CSS foundation

#### **Dependencies Installed**

- `fastapi`: Web framework
- `sqlalchemy`: ORM
- `pydantic`: Data validation
- `jinja2`: Templates

#### **Next Steps Ready**
- Day 2 can begin immediately with ORM model implementation
- Alembic is ready for initial migration creation
- FastAPI application can be started and tested
- All foundation components are in place

#### 📚 Day 1 Lessons Learned

1. **Clean Start Strategy Pays Off**: Backing up existing code and starting fresh was essential. The existing 21-day comprehensive implementation would have confused our 7-day prototype approach and created unnecessary complexity.

2. **Modular Architecture Decision Was Critical**: Separating `repository/` (data layer) from `webui/` (interface layer) provides clear boundaries and will make future maintenance much easier. This separation will also help when we scale to production.

3. **SQLite Configuration Nuances Mattered**: Using `check_same_thread=False` and StaticPool was essential for FastAPI compatibility. Without these specific settings, we would have encountered threading issues during development.

4. **Alembic Batch Mode for SQLite**: Enabling `render_as_batch=True` in Alembic environment configuration was crucial. SQLite doesn't support complex ALTER operations, and batch mode uses the move-and-copy pattern to handle schema changes safely.

5. **Context7 MCP Tools Were Invaluable**: Using Context7 for getting up-to-date FastAPI and Pydantic best practices provided significant value. The concrete code examples and current patterns saved hours of research time.

6. **Pydantic Schema Design Strategy**: Creating comprehensive schemas for both repository (data validation) and webui (form handling) proved wise. The separation allows different validation rules for different contexts while maintaining consistency.

7. **Template Foundation Simplified Future Work**: Setting up Jinja2 templates with proper structure early will make Day 4 web interface development much smoother. Having base.html with proper CSS integration established a solid foundation.

8. **Settings Pattern Consistency**: Using Pydantic Settings with environment prefixes (REPO_ and WEBUI_) maintains consistency with existing vpsweb patterns while allowing clear separation of concerns.

9. **File Organization Matters**: Creating the exact directory structure from the PSD before writing any code made the implementation flow naturally and prevented rework later.

10. **MCP Tools Usage Pattern**: Using MCP tools proactively (before implementation) rather than reactively (when stuck) proved much more effective. Context7 provided patterns that we could adapt directly.

#### **Surprising Discoveries**
- SQLite's performance with WAL mode exceeded expectations for a local prototype
- FastAPI's static file mounting was simpler than anticipated
- Pydantic v2 validation patterns were more intuitive than expected
- Alembic's batch mode for SQLite worked seamlessly once configured properly

#### **Process Insights**
- The Strategy-Todo-Code-Reflection process worked exceptionally well for Day 1
- Breaking down the monolithic task into 5 specific, testable tasks made progress measurable
- Having the enhanced PSD with concrete examples provided much better guidance than generic documentation
- Regular MCP tool usage for research accelerated development significantly

#### **Technical Debt Avoided**
- No shortcuts taken in database configuration (proper SQLite setup)
- Comprehensive schema design from the start prevents future migration pain
- Proper error handling patterns established early
- Type annotations used throughout for better IDE support and error catching

- **Code Review**: Addressed all critical issues from comprehensive review
- **Architecture**: Leveraged existing v0.3.0 utilities (datetime, language, ULID)
- **Testing**: Foundation ready for comprehensive test coverage
- **Documentation**: Clear storage architecture prevents future confusion

**💡 Key Lessons Learned:**
- **Modern SQLAlchemy 2.0 patterns work excellently with FastAPI**: Using `Mapped`, `mapped_column`, and proper relationships provides clean, type-safe ORM models
- **ULID integration provides significant architectural benefits**: Time-sortable IDs make debugging and chronological ordering much easier
- **Type safety validation catches critical bugs early**: The `runtime_seconds` float/integer mismatch would have caused data truncation in production
- **Comprehensive code reviews essential for production readiness**: External review caught architectural inconsistencies and critical bugs
- **v0.3.0 utility integration accelerates development significantly**: Leveraging existing datetime_utils, language_mapper, and ulid_utils saved development time
- **Database-first storage architecture prevents synchronization issues**: Clear documentation of storage relationships prevents future data consistency problems
- **Cascading deletes must be carefully designed**: Proper `cascade="all, delete-orphan"` ensures data integrity when parent records are deleted
- **Pydantic validation should match database constraints**: Schema validation provides early error detection before database operations

**🚀 Day 2 Reflections & Future Improvements:**
- **Testing Strategy**: In-memory SQLite with pytest fixtures provides fast, reliable testing
- **Migration Management**: Alembic with `render_as_batch=True` is essential for SQLite compatibility
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try/catch with rollback patterns ensures database consistency
